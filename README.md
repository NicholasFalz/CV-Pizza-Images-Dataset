The train, valid and test folders contain the dataset which we created. Inside these are the images as well as the labels created through annotations.

Additionally, inside 'Task3Files' one can find the notebooks used in order to train the models, the logs generated for each model and most importantly the prediction of each model we implemented in Task 3 on our test images.
